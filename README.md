# LeetCode Solutions in Go

My solutions to LeetCode problems, practicing algorithms and data structures.

## Structure

```
algorithms/     # Core algorithm implementations
examples/       # Common data structures (trees, linked lists)
problems/       # LeetCode problem solutions
util/          # Helper functions
```

## Focus Areas

- Data Structures (Trees, Linked Lists, Arrays)
- Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming)
- Problem-solving patterns
